This is an application currently still in development mode while awaiting approval from Spotify for public access.
The application serves as a way for users to check their Spotify listening stats from a selection of 3 timeframes and two categories, artists and tracks.
Users are able to post their stats to a database to be viewed by followers as well as view posts by others they choose to follow. Users are able to share one
view of stats and one playlist, none Spotify created, that they've recently been listening to.
Users can test the application with a Spotify test account I have available: email: quinnton.carter@vschool.io password: 73571ng4cc
